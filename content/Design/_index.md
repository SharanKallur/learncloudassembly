The <strong>Design</strong> tab is your development home.<br> 
Deployments begin with [Cloud Templates](/Design/Cloud_Templates/), formerly called blueprints, which are the specifications that define the machines, applications, and services that you create on cloud resources by way of [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html) Cloud Assembly.

As a [Cloud Templates](/Design/Cloud_Templates/) developer, you can design templates that target specific cloud vendors, or make them cloud agnostic. The [cloud zones](Infrastructure/Configure/Cloud-Zones/) that are assigned to your project determine which approach you might take. Check with your cloud administrator to make sure that you understand what kind of resources make up your [cloud zones](Infrastructure/Configure/Cloud-Zones/).

Be aware that [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html) Cloud Assembly template creation is an infrastructure-as-code process. You add and connect resources in the design canvas to get started. Then, you complete the details using the code editor to the right of the canvas. The code editor allows you to type code directly or enter property values into a form.
