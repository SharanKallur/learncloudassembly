## What is Resource View?

Resource View is another angle on managing resources and workloads in [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html). You may already be familiar with the concept of deployments: resource groups that group resource together. Instead of managing resources by resource groups, you also have the option to manage resources directly.

## What features are included in this Resource View release?

At the Resource View functionality Users can switch between an <strong>“All Resources view”</strong>, <strong>“Machine View”</strong>, <strong>“Network View”</strong> and <strong>”Storage View”</strong>.

Users can also mix-and-match different sub types (e.g. AWS machines + vSphere disks).

Because each category of resource (machine/network/storage) has its own special key factors, [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html) created views tailored to these resources. You can also continue to access day 2 action lists by the tab button to the left of the resource name.
