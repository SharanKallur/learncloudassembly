A cloud administrator can review compute resources that are exposed through data collection.

The cloud administrator might choose to apply [tags](/Infrastructure/Configure/Tags/)  directly to the resources to label capabilities for matching purposes in [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html)  provisioning.

Several filtering options are available.
