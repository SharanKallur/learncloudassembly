In [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html), all users can review machine resources that are exposed through data collection.

Unmanaged machines that are associated to [cloud accounts](/Infrastructure/Connections/Cloud-Accounts/) in your [projects](/Infrastructure/Administration/Projects/) appear in this list, as do managed machines. The Origin column indicates the machine status.

1. Discovered - machines that have not yet been onboarded.
2. Deployed - machines that have been onboarded or provisioned from vRealize Automation and are considered to be managed machines.

Other machine information, such as custom properties and memory, is also collected and displayed.
