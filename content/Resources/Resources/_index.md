## What is Resource View?

Resource View is another angle on managing resources and workloads in [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html). You may already be familiar with the concept of deployments: resource groups that group resource together. Instead of managing resources by resource groups, you also have the option to manage resources directly.
