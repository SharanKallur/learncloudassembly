Users can also mix-and-match different sub types (e.g. AWS machines + vSphere disks).

Because each category of resource (machine/network/storage) has its own special key factors, [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html) created views tailored to these resources. You can also continue to access day 2 action lists by the tab button to the left of the resource name.
