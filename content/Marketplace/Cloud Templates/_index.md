To jumpstart your resource library, download files from the vRealize Automation Cloud Assembly <strong>Marketplace</strong>.

For a Project-based example, imagine that you are a project administrator for a Big Data effort. To assist your team, you locate a Marketplace Hadoop template by using the searching capabilities and narrowing with the filter options, e.g. Cloud Services, Database Services, Platform as a Service, etc.
