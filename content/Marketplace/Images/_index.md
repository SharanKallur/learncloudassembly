 click <strong>Get</strong>, and accept the OVF or OVA image EULA. Afterward, you can download the OVF or OVA image and reference it in [Cloud Template](/Design/Cloud_Templates/) code.

You download a Hadoop OVF and add it to cloud account resources such as a vCenter Server Content Library. You then update any [Cloud Template](/Design/Cloud_Templates/) code that needs to point to the OVF image.
