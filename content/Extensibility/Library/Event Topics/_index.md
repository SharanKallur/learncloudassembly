## Event Topics

Describes a set of events that have the same logical intent and the same structure. Every event is an instance of an event topic. You can assign blocking parameters to certain event topic.

Event topics are the categories that group similar events together. 

When assigned to a subscription, event topics define which event triggers the subscription. All topics can be used to add or update custom properties or tags of the resource. If a vRealize Orchestrator workflow or extensibility action fails, the corresponding task fails as well.
