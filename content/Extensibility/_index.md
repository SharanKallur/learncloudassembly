Event-Based Extensibility has a long history within VMware’s Automation and Operations suites. Extensibility has traditionally been defined as how we create interactions with platforms outside of our management platform. Some of the most common examples of this are…

<ul>
    <li>Interacting with IPAM Systems (Infoblox, BlueCat, etc)
    <li>Pushing records into Configuration Management Databases (CMDB’s)
    <li>Creating Records in DNS
    <li>Interactions with various REST platforms</li>
</ul>
